## Problem
Some items, such as electronics, do not last forever. We often forget when we purchased our products or how long we have used them, only for them to reach their lifespan unexpectedly. We also don’t actively keep track of our products’ warranty while living our daily lives, it’s always useful to know whether our devices are still liable for RMA (Return merchandise authorization) early on.  

## Solution 
The solution to the mentioned problems is to have a time tracking app. The app allows users to create a list of items. For each item, the user can assign a date of purchase, and a date of warranty or protection purchase if applicable. The app will then calculate and show the difference between current time and time entered to the users, giving them an idea of how long they have been using an item and how long until the item’s warranty expires if applicable.
